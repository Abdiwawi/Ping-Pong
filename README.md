# Ping-Pong Game

1.This is a game where a user types in a number and gets a list of answers depending on the number typed in.
For example: <br>If a user keys in a number divisible by :<br>(a)3 with a %(modulo) of zero it returns Ping!
                                                     <br>(b)5 with a %(modulo) of zero it returns Pong!
                                                     <br>(c)15 with a %(modulo) of zero it returns PingPong!
                                                     <br>(d)it shows numbers as usual.
